# Multimedia-Steganography-Project

Steganography is a fascinating field of study that involves hiding secret information in plain sight. 
It has various applications in the digital world, such as protecting sensitive data, concealing covert messages, and more. 
We are using  the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique, which is a common method of steganography.
This technique involves embedding secret data by replacing the least significant bit of each pixel in an image or audio file. 
By doing this, the change is subtle and not easily noticeable to the naked eye. 
The embedded message can only be retrieved by someone who knows the method used to conceal it.
